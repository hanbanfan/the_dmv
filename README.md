<!-- DMV Project
What I Did
This project simulates a DMV system using Ruby and follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and Test-Driven Development (TDD).

Facility Management: Created a Facility class to track DMV locations and their services.

Vehicle Management: Built a Vehicle class to handle vehicle registrations, plate types (regular, electric, antique), and registration dates.

Registrant Services: Added a Registrant class to manage individual permits, written tests, road tests, and license renewals.

Data Integration: Integrated external data sources using the DmvDataService class to fetch DMV facilities and vehicle registration data.

Factories: Created VehicleFactory and FacilityFactory classes to process and build objects from external data.
Testing: Used RSpec to test all classes, methods, and edge cases for correctness and reliability.
Key Features
